# Bugs

Probably many. Not mine bugs are:

* ORACLE/APEX: 'virtual circuit waits' APEX 5.1 performance problem
* ORACLE/APEX: ORA-04031: unable to allocate 3896 bytes of shared memory - memory leak in APEX 5.1?
* Perl: some nasty END or destructor code from Image::ObjectDetect hangs in perl code!
* Perl: ColorObject.pm needs patching to not to produce annoyable warnings
* Perl: Image::Libpuzzle probably needs patching too (see its repo discussion)
* Perl: Module::Compile is not installed by the first cpanm try, don't know why
